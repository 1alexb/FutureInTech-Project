// <--- 09/04/2023 @Alex Created webform and class Car.
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alex Boolean for 'is Available' webform checkbox was missing from class Car. Added a auto-implemented property and the constructor for it.
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alex TODO Not all SpeedyCarform.Designer.cs button labels follow naming norms. Need to rename them accordingly. 
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alex TODO There is a button missing from the form, forgot to add it. It is the central button from the lower bar that enumerates between the array of cars. Needs to be added. 
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alenka The files aren’t named as per Brian’s instructions. I tried renaming them but renaming broke some code so I left them unchanged. They should be named as follows: Save the form files as frmCars and frmSearch and the Project as CarsDatabase.
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alenka Slightly realigned a few elements on the form
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alenka renamed Form 2 to FrmCars as per Brian's instructions + text displayed from Form 2 to Task A
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alenka renamed Registration Number text box to txtRegistrationNumber, Make text box to txtMake, Engine Size text box to txtEngineSize, Date Registered text box to txtDateRegistered
// <--- 10/04/2023 @Alenka renamed Rental Per Day text box to txtRentalPerDay and changed formatting to 99.99
// <--- 11/04/2023 @Alenka created Record Count button and named it txtRecordCount

// <--- 11/04/2023 @Alenka Exit button is underlined under x in Brian’s file - which is correct?
// <--- 11/04/2023 @Alenka changed text property of the form FrmCars (see SpeedyCarForm.cs under comment //3)
// <--- 11/04/2023 @Alenka changed the name of checkbox to chkAvailable
// <--- 11/04/2023 @Alenka I don't know whether we need car class - Brian doesn't have it in his file

// <--- 12/04/2023 @Alex Commented the whole class Car, keeping in it there just in case we might need it onwards.
// <--- 12/04/2023 @Alex The form is showing now for editing, I just double clicked into SpeedyCarForm.cs and can see it.
// <--- 12/04/2023 @Alex The project is named now 'CarsDatabase' and the form 'frmCars' as suggested. Edit the parts so that the code works after the renaming.

// <--- 21/04/2023 @Alex The 200 ambiguity errors were caused by using the wrong namespace. Every namespace must be onwards 'CarsDatabase´instead of the old 'SP_CarDB' renamed all accordingly. Errors are gone now.
// <--- 21/04/2023 @Alex Removed class Car as it looks we will not need it. I have a local copy anyways. Cleaned up the tree.

// <--- 23/04/2023 @Alenka Corrected the typo of double // in the date on the frmCars.cs form
// <--- 23/04/2023 @Alenka Created frmSearch (tasks 15 and 16 in Brian's instructions)
// <--- 23/04/2023 @Alenka Created SQL database Hire with tblCar but couldn't connect to it; also, how does this work when collaborating since it is bound to my computer?

// <--- 24/04/2023 @Alex --> This version connects to the database. You need to install a NuGet Package in order to make it work:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Choose "Manage NuGet Packages".
3. On the "Browse" tab and search for "System.Data.SqlClient".
4. Select the package and click "Install" to add it to your project.

// The buttons need to be implemented yet, but this one step solved towards it.
